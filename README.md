##Overview
This repository is used to share the things I learned by studying the course Microservices with Java Spring Boot Cloud from Udemy Business. Here are some topics of the subjects covered:
- Microservice Architeture
- Spring Boot
- Spring Cloud

## Microservice x Monolithic

The image below show us the main difference between this two architetures. In monolithic architetura, everything is condensed in a block of code. In a microservice architeture we have different services that interact with each other sharing data and requisitions.
